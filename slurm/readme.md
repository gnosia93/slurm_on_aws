## Super Quick Start ##

* Download source from https://www.schedmd.com/download-slurm/

* As of Dec 20 2024, version 24.11.0 is the lastest version, and download url is https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-24.11.0.tar.bz2  







* Make sure the clocks, users and groups (UIDs and GIDs) are synchronized across the cluster.
    - NOTE: The SlurmUser must exist prior to starting Slurm and must exist on all nodes of the cluster.

* Install MUNGE for authentication. Make sure that all nodes in your cluster have the same munge.key. Make sure the MUNGE daemon, munged, is started before you start the Slurm daemons.
  
* Install Slurm using one of the following methods:
  * Build Manually from source (for developers or advanced users)
  * NOTE: The parent directories for Slurm's log files, process ID files, state save directories, etc. are not created by Slurm. They must be created and made writable by SlurmUser as needed prior to starting Slurm daemons.

  ```
  curl https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-24.11.0.tar.bz2 -o slurm-24.11.0.tar.bz2
  tar -xaf slurm-24.11.0.tar.bz2
  cd slurm-24.11.0
  ./configure
  ./make install
  ```

* Install the configuration file in <sysconfdir>/slurm.conf.
  * NOTE: You will need to install this configuration file on all nodes of the cluster.
  * <sysconfdir> is /usr/local if you compile source code by your self and didn't set prefix  
* systemd (optional): enable the appropriate services on each system:
  * Controller: sudo systemctl enable slurmctld
  * Database: sudo systemctl enable slurmdbd
  * Compute Nodes: sudo systemctl enable slurmd
* Start the slurmctld and slurmd daemons.
  * eg. sudo systemctl start slurmctld
