**This workshop explains about how to use AWS graviton EC2 instances for pytorch distributed training with slurm.** 
AWS Graviton processors are custom-built by AWS to deliver the best price performance for cloud workloads. Graviton-based instance is upto 20% more cheaper than X86-based and provide better performance in same generation. AWS Graviton3 optimized for ML workloads and provide the `Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)` while also supporting `bfloat16`. 

Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.
